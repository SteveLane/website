# Welcome to my research page

I am Deputy Director and Research Fellow with the [Centre of Excellence for Biosecurity Risk Analysis](http://cebra.unimelb.edu.au/) at The University of Melbourne, Parkville. I am interested in effective data communication, and in the preparation, collation and management of complex datasets.

At the top of the page you'll find links to my [GitHub](https://github.com/SteveLane/) account, as well as my [twitter](https://twitter.com/stephenelane/) account.
