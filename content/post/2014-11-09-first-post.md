Well, this is exciting! This is the first post ever on
[www.StephenELane.com]({{site.url}}).

Actually, maybe it's not that exciting - there is after all, only this single
post currently here, as well as the [about me](/about) page, which admittedly,
is not quite so complete either!

There's also an [archive](/archive) page, where links to all articles will
appear, based on how they're tagged.

Finally, there's a link in the sidebar to my [GitHub]({{site.github.repo}})
repo. Mostly, I've just posted up links to various presentations I've given
there, but I'm sure more goodies will arrive one day!

Hopefully I can keep the momentum up, and post often!
