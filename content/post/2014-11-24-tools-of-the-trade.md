There's many pieces of software I use on a daily basis, along with some I use
less frequently. In this post, I'm just going to list some of these out, but in
subsequent posts, I'll go into a little more detail about what I use and why, as
well as how I structure my projects.

This list is in no particular order:

- R ([http://r-project.org/](http://r-project.org/))
  - My statistical package of choice. R has a great community, there are many
    resources for beginner's, and those more advanced, and it's open source and
    free!
- emacs
  ([http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/))
  - I prefer to write everything in a text editor. I'll go into detail in a
    later post, and try and remember to link to it from here. I'm not interested
    in an emacs vs. [vi/vim](http://www.vim.org/) war. You can read about that
    all over the interwebs (it has a
    [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war) page too)
- git/GitHub
  ([http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/) and [https://github.com/](https://github.com/))
  - Distributed version control. Keep your source files synced across
    computers/systems. Git is the version control system, and github is an
    online repository for your files. This blog is hosted on <a
    href="{{site.github.repo}}">GitHub</a>.
- pandoc
  ([http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/))
  - As stated on its *about* page, pandoc is '&hellip; your swiss-army
    knife'. You can use pandoc to convert between different markup formats. As
    an example, this post is written in markdown, but using pandoc, I could
    easily convert it to a Word document with a single commandline command.
- Excel
  ([http://office.microsoft.com/en-AU/excel/](http://office.microsoft.com/en-AU/excel/))
  - I really don't need to say anything, or link to it, but I've done it for the
    others, so let's be fair! Spreadsheets are a great way of getting a quick
    overview of your data (after it has been collected), but leaving the
    analysis and graphical displays to better tools (R, stata, etc.)
- REDCap ([http://www.project-redcap.org/](http://www.project-redcap.org/))
  - We use REDCap at our institution for data management, and I use it
    personally to track my projects. It's an easy to use web-based application
    for creating and managing databases for surveys and research. It's free, but
    you (your institution) need to join the REDCap consortium as a partner to
    get the code

I use other software as well, and also use the mighty pen-and-paper system as
well, but I'll discuss those in later posts, if and when I need to.
