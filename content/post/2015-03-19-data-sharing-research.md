I work with many different researchers, with varying levels of technical
expertise. Students, junior physicians, consultant physicians, academics of all
persuasions. Wherever I can I promote a consultative approach to projects, that
begins with (ideally) a discussion prior to the research design being decided,
but definitely before data collection has started.

I came across
[this post](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/11/14/the-leek-group-guide-to-sharing-data-with-a-statistician-to-speed-collaboration/)
by Jeff Leek again recently&mdash;I have no idea why/what prompted me to read it
again&mdash;and whilst I agree with pretty much all of what Jeff says, and I
definitely feel his pain in receiving horribly ugly datasets, I think that we
(statisticians/analysts/whatevers) can do more to help the situation (especially
if we are involved at the start of the conversation). And doing more starts with
promoting good data capture habits, and if working in an institution, providing
access to, and help with the tools to capture data efficiently and tidily.

What is required is a solid database solution that is easy enough for anyone to
pick up and run with it. When I say anyone, I'm thinking anyone that has basic
computer skills, for example, word processing and spreadsheet skills. We'd like
the researcher to be able to enter data into a form, have some form of
validation applied to the data, and then have an easy way to extract the data
afterwards for analysis.

Now, a lot of people will have access to Microsoft Access, but I've found that
for your average Joe, it's too difficult, with too much of a learning curve. As
a free solution, I think that [EpiData](http://www.epidata.dk/) is probably
worth a look, especially if you cannot convince your IT folks to provide you
with anything else.

If you can get the support of your institution/IT folk, then
[REDCap](http://project-redcap.org/) is a great solution. You can follow the
previous link to read more about it, but briefly, REDCap is a web-based
electronic data capture application, that is geared towards research. It makes
it easy to set up a project database within your web browser (the tables
etc. are created automagically for you on the backend), it's free for
institutions, and has some great features like the ability to run online
surveys, full user-access controls, and audit trails.

An alternative geared towards those in the clinical space is
[OpenClinica](https://www.openclinica.com/), which as I understand it has
similar features to REDCap, but I haven't used it personally, so don't quote me!
