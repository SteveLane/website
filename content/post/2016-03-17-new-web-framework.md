I started a new role recently, and to complement that I decided that I wanted to
redesign my website! So here it is.

The plan is to try and create public GitHub repos for my research projects (when
there are no privacy issues), in an effort to promote more open science. I'd
really like this to take cues from the
[lab notebook](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/09/28/Welcome-to-my-lab-notebook.html)
of <a href="https://github.com/cboettig/"><i class="fa
fa-github"></i>@cboettig</a>. Similar ideas can be found at
[Lincoln Mullen's](http://lincolnmullen.com/) website.

Currently I just have some random blog posts on this website (see the
[archive]({{ site.baseurl }}blog/archive)). But it'll build up eventually!
