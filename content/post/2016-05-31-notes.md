### Found out about org-ref

-   [org-ref](https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref/blob/master/org-ref.org)
    makes it easy to do cross-referencing (!)
-   the citation command is `C-c ]`
    -   If you do `C-u` before selecting the reference in `helm-bibtex`
        then you can use different citation types (e.g. p, t)
-   references to labels can also be added
    -   there is currently no default key-binding for adding labels
        and/or refs

Tasks
-----

### [TODO]{.todo .TODO} Add in default key-bindings for org-ref {#add-in-default-key-bindings-for-org-ref}

-   org-ref can add refs/labels, but I need to add in some default
    key-bindings
-   I should probably also look at turning org-ref on for all org files
    -   this should not turn on reftex-mode either
