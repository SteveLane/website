-   Report for International EpiLab
-   Provides case studies on scenario tree modelling, so a good place to
    start reading in this area, even though it\'s a little old (2003)
-   The ultimate goal is to estimate the *surveillance process\'s
    sensitivity*
    -   this is the probability of detecting an infected unit, given the
        area is infected (under some design prevalence)
    -   $\Pr\left(\geq 1\text{ infected unit }\big|\text{ country infected}\right)$
-   If there is a positive (confirmed) test on a unit, then clearly the
    area is not free from disease!
-   Layman\'s summary for scenario tree:
    -   Combines probabilities in each step of the surveillance system
        to output an overall probability that the surveillance system
        will detect the disease if present
-   For a scenario tree, they define conditional probabilities by
    considering preconditions
    -   That is, all parent nodes to the current node
-   Confidence = overall sensitivity
-   Use hypothesis testing as a framework
    -   Hence the *design prevalence*[^1] as the *null* hypothesis
    -   We then compare output based on the assumed design prevalence
-   Suggest in S2.3.3 that Bayesian probabilities can be used at the end
    of modelling to produce a probability of freedom from disease
    -   As opposed to the probability of detection as above
-   All nodes in a scenario tree are *conditional* on all parent nodes
-   Unit of analysis is important
    -   []{#crops}What happens with variable size units? E.g. crops or
        herds?
-   Ordering of nodes is not important
    -   as opposed to graphical models?
    -   it does affect the conditional probabilities though, so keeps
        them easier to specify
-   Factors to include are those that influence the probability of
    infection or detection
    -   So in response to [above](#crops), variable sizing would need to
        be included somehow
    -   This would then suggest for a continuous measure like crop size
        (e.g. in Ha), it would be better to go to a more flexible
        modelling tool that allows a continuous node
    -   They suggest with the note, capturing variability
-   Recommend stochastic modelling, with each branch probability having
    uncertainty in the form of an appropriate probability distribution
    -   How that stochastic modelling is done is what I\'m interested in
        mainly
-   Branch probabilities
    -   They say you need to use data!
    -   Of course, but that\'s the hard part
    -   Need to use data from similar diseases or geographies for a
        large part of this
    -   Otherwise, expert opinion, which the go in to
-   Surveillance systems with incomplete coverage (e.g. targeted
    surveillance) require two model fits
    1.  That using the actual data using design prevalence
    2.  One using a *representative* surveillance process, which uses
        estimated prevalence, and simulated data/units
        -   With the same number of units as in the actual data
-   Estimating the probability of freedom from infection is then easily
    done using Bayes theorem, and law of total probability
-   Sensitivity analysis should be performed
    -   But doesn\'t say how in S2.5.2.3.8
-   Provides a brief excursion into expert opinion
    -   Including the gathering and analysis of such data to provide
        node probability distributions
-   Doesn\'t really go in to how the probabilities are traced through
    the tree
    -   I\'m wondering whether this is the process:
        1.  For any of the nodes that have a distribution attached, make
            a draw from them
        2.  Calculate the final node probabilities (for positive, i.e.
            infected animal) by multiplying together all of the
            conditional probabilities that trace to that node
        3.  Sum all these probabilities to produce the probability of
            detecting a positive animal
        4.  Repeat `nreps` times to give a distribution of estimates for
            the probability of detecting a positive animal
        5.  Calculate required sensitivities

Footnotes
---------

[^1]: *Design* refers to the fact that this prevalence is a part of the
    design of the model/system and is not related to any actual
    prevalence within the system.
