### Objective function for voting model selection

\<2016-06-14 Tue 11:43\>

-   The objective function is to minimise the average cv error
    -   This is because we want to minimise MSE (or some other
        statistic) on an *unseen* dataset
-   However, mean-CV error is just an estimate of MSE due to the
    resampling used
-   So, do we believe that argmin mean-CV is the best way to choose *λ*
    -   (or some other model feature)
-   How about if we want the *λ* that is most popular
    -   That is, the one which would be optimal most of the time
    -   Do they converge to each other in the limit?
    -   Like saying we want the *λ* that results in the most lowest-MSEs
        in new, *unseen* data, not just averages them
