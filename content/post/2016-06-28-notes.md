### Statistician Heal Thyself: Have We Lost the Plot?

Gordon, I., & Finch, S. (2015). [Statistician Heal Thyself: Have We Lost
the
Plot?](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2014.989324)
Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics: A Joint Publication
of American Statistical Association, Institute of Mathematical
Statistics, Interface Foundation of North America, 24(4), 1210--1229.

-   this is an article about graphics in science and statistics journals
-   I think graphical display of data is much easier to parse than
    tabled data
    -   but many (applied) journals specify a maximum of figures per
        article!

    > a high quality graph should be able to be interpreted without
    > elaboration

-   Figure 1 shows a cluttered display
    -   I think there\'s a ggplot2 function to push labels apart
    -   yes, here it is: [ggrepel](https://github.com/slowkow/ggrepel)
-   Figure 2 provides a redesign
    -   basically a small multiples plot
    -   this is an improvement, but if the relationship is not monotone,
        then this figure would look a bit messy
-   Figure 3 provides a scatterplot alternative
    -   the authors suggest that it is easy to see that average lifespan
        increases with education, but I find this difficult
    -   I can more easily see the decrease in lifespan variation with
        increasing education though
-   Principle 3:

    > Use good alignment on a common scale for quantities to be
    > compared.

    -   pie charts and stacked bar charts fail this principle
        -   stacked bar charts because only one category (the bottom
            one) is aligned against the common axis
    -   panel plots also fail this?

-   The figures in the article themselves are fuzzy
    -   perhaps the authors could have taken their own advice?!
-   Detection was found to be the main issue
    -   This refers to how we find out about features of the graph
-   They provide a checklist at the end of the article for those
    producing graphics
