### Estimating intervals after expert elicitation

-   A simple clipped average is seen to be perform well (Lyon, Wintle
    and Burgman, 2015)
-   But what about some other way of aggregation?
-   What about minimising difference from implied distributions to the
    *target*
    -   e.g. by Kullback-Leibler divergence
