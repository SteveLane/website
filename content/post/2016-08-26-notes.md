### Trying to reorganise agenda files

-   my agenda files started clogging up my init.el
-   if you set `org-agenda-files` to a filename, it\'ll use that file to
    store the list of files used for the agenda
-   upshot is, it works a charm
    -   make sure though, that if you\'re copying over your previous
        `org-agenda-files` list, you don\'t put the filenames in quotes

### Yasnippet

-   I use [Yasnippet](https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet) for
    templating in emacs, but I was getting stupid templates for some
    modes
-   Yasnippet sets up default templates which are used by default
    (surprise, surprise!)
-   [this emacs
    stackexchange](http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/18800/disable-default-yasnippet-snippets)
    shows how to turn off the defaults
