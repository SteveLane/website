### Species-fragmented area relationship

-   Reading for QAECO reading group
-   relationship between increasing number of species and increasing
    area of habitat
    -   (so I suppose inverse is true, e.g. climate change reduce area
        of habitat, reduce number of species?)
    -   predict number of extinctions due to loss of habitat
-   the issue is fragmentation
    -   habitat loss generally results in a fragmented (sub) habitat
    -   SAR assumes contiguous regions (think a circle getting smaller)
    -   fragmentation is when holes appear (think a doughnut)
-   (meta) population capacity is essentially the carrying capacity of
    the habitat
-   fragmentation causes this to decline
    -   e.g. due to disconnect between fragments
-   SFAR (species-fragmented area relationship) fits better than SAR in
    simulations
-   Figure 1
    -   the authors suggest the SAR does not fit the number of species
        well, but it looks like it does to me? The lines are pretty
        close to the points?
    -   I think perhaps the figure legend is not described well --- the
        lines are not SARs but just general fitted lines?
-   Species traits
    -   when including the fragmentation part, the authors suggest a
        large amount of variation in the ratio of extinction and
        colonisation
    -   this has an effect on their $b$ parameter
    -   how are the models fit? stupid pnas, need to check in
        supplementary material
-   Case study uses only 14 points
-   they suggest that species number is reduced due to fragmentation
-   a better visualisation would be to use points proportional to
    $\lambda$ in Figure 4A
-   They suggest hat SFAR is better than SAR, due to a difference in
    AICc of 2.44 (!)
-   furthermore, the least-squares value of the area coefficient is
    negative, meaning that conditional on $\lambda$, the number of
    species $S$ is *increasing* as area $A$ decreases
    -   **what**!?
    -   this same thing happens in eqn 3, where if $z < 0$, if
        $A_{\text{new}} < A$, \$S~new~/S \>1 \$!
-   they do discuss what they term *hidden* parameters: those used for
    estimating $\lambda$
    -   perhaps these should be estimated in a hierarchical model?
