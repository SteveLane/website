### Delta method and bootstrap in linear mixed models to estimate a proportion when no event is observed: application to intralesional resection in bone tumor surgery

Francq, B. G., & Cartiaux, O. (2016). Delta method and bootstrap in
linear mixed models to estimate a proportion when no event is observed:
application to intralesional resection in bone tumor surgery. Statistics
in Medicine. <https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.6939>

-   Estimation of rare proportions
    -   could be useful for my work
    -   I wonder how many zeroes can be in the data for this method to
        work
        -   that will be my main question at the moment
-   Give the example of adverse events in clinical trials
    -   here, many adverse events will have 0 counts
-   Provide a toy example of estimating probabilities of height
    thresholds in small samples
    -   expect different probabilities from different thresholds
    -   clearly due to ordering of heights
-   the problem with the existing methods is that they give the same
    interval for different thresholds
    -   e.g. when when two observations fall below a threshold
        -   here they have different values, but give a 0 value anyway
        -   so they should have different intervals due to the different
            values
-   first extension is the delta method on the z-score
    -   using the observed values, calculate sample mean and sd, and
        z-score
    -   find variance of the z-score using delta method
    -   then confidence interval of z-score gets transformed for the
        probability confidence interval
-   can also be used on the cdf of z
    -   this has problems with intervals though
-   standard nonparametric bootstrap doesn\'t work
    -   if you have no events, none will be in the bootstrap resamples!
