### Massive yet grossly underestimated global costsof invasive insects

Bradshaw, C. J. A., Leroy, B., Bellard, C., Roiz, D., Albert, C.,
Fournier, A., ... Courchamp, F. (2016). Massive yet grossly
underestimated global costs of invasive insects. Nature Communications,
7, 12986. <https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms12986>

-   Quote that 87% of non-native terrestrial invertebrates in Europe are
    insects
    -   whilst true, given that 80% of invertebrates are insects, it\'s
        not surprising!
    -   it certainly helps their story though
-   essentially a literature review
    -   each study was classified by *reproducibility* --- as in, enough
        good information to calculate costs
    -   as opposed to quality, as they say there\'s no objective,
        standard methodology for this
    -   this is a good reason to develop this!
-   they discuss that regional relative costs are most likely a function
    of research effort, as opposed to actual differences in cost
-   the costs are most likely gross underestimates
    -   due to limited studies and poor coverage in under-developed
        countries
-   total cost estimate of USD\$70 billion/year
