Dagnammit. I've gone and done it again. New site. With a new name, GTownDS: Geelong Data Scientist!

This time around, I'm using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and the [ghostwriter](https://themes.gohugo.io/ghostwriter/) theme --- well, my slight [adaptation](https://github.com/SteveLane/ghostwriter) of it anyway.

Once again, this is an attempt to rebuild my connection with writing down some stuff on a more constant note. I've heard that before...
