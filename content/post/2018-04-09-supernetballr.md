This is something I've been thinking about for a while, and have finally got around to implementing. I've built a very simple package to download and manipulate [super netball](https://supernetball.com.au/) match and player statistics.

You can find details about the package [here](https://stevelane.github.io/superNetballR/), and source code for the package [here](https://github.com/SteveLane/superNetballR)

At present, the package contains tidied data for the 2017 season, which will be available upon installation. Functions to retrieve games are also included, and I will endeavour to update the package a couple of times throughout the 2018 season. Currently, there are only functions to tidy the match and player statistics and create simple ladders, so there's plenty of work to be done.

My goal is to do some modelling and commentary on the games --- let's see if I can!
