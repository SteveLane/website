The first round of the 2018 Super Netball season is just about on us! Here's a summary of what [my model]({{< relref "2018-04-22-introduction.md" >}}) is predicting as the outcomes in the first round.


|Home                  |Away                     |Chance of home team winning |
|:---------------------|:------------------------|:---------------------------|
|Melbourne Vixens      |Magpies Netball          |51%                         |
|Adelaide Thunderbirds |West Coast Fever         |69%                         |
|GIANTS Netball        |Sunshine Coast Lightning |25%                         |
|NSW Swifts            |Queensland Firebirds     |16%                         |

## Score Differential Distributions

The distribution of the predicted score differentials is shown in the figures below. For each game, the chance of the home team winning is calculated and shown in the figure title. Each distribution is coloured by the team's colours, and the more of a single team's colour, the higher the chance that team has of winning. Overlaid on each figure are two vertical, dashed dark green lines; these show the score differential that has a 50% predicted chance of happening.
