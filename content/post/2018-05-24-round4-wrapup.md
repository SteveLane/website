No commentary this week, I've had an ordinary one...

If you missed my round 4 predictions, [here they are]({{< relref "2018-05-16-round4.md" >}}).

## Wrap-up


|Home                  |Away                     |Chance of home team winning | Home Score| Away Score|Winner                   |
|:---------------------|:------------------------|:---------------------------|----------:|----------:|:------------------------|
|GIANTS Netball        |Queensland Firebirds     |50%                         |         53|         51|GIANTS Netball           |
|Adelaide Thunderbirds |Melbourne Vixens         |4%                          |         50|         72|Melbourne Vixens         |
|West Coast Fever      |NSW Swifts               |66%                         |         63|         54|West Coast Fever         |
|Magpies Netball       |Sunshine Coast Lightning |39%                         |         50|         52|Sunshine Coast Lightning |

<!-- Is the model now hitting its stride? It gave the Vixens a 36% chance of winning, and unfortunately they went down to the Firebirds, who are looking quite strong. -->

<!-- The Fever were very slight favourites (56%) away from home, and they got the job done against the Lightning who rely do have a premiership hangover. -->

<!-- The Magpies were strong favourites (80%) against the Thunderbirds, and the result was a true thrashing. 20 goals the difference, poor ol' Thunderbirds, looks like another year of dwelling in the cellar. -->

<!-- The final game of the round saw the Swifts beat the Giants. The Giants were hotly fancied by the model (79%), but in a close game, the Swifts got the job done. -->

## Team Abilities

Now that there's a few rounds down, let's check out how the model views the team ability:

!["team-abilities"](/sn-assets/round5-2018/abilities.png)

It's a good reality check that the Vixens estimated ability does not change; they played a team (Thunderbirds) they were expected to beat by a large margin. Thus, the Vixens ability should not change.

I wrote briefly about these abilities last round. See [here]({{< relref "2018-05-16-round3-wrapup.md" >}}) for details.
