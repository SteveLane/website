Similar to last week, I've only just got back from the US, and so I've had limited opportunities to check out all the matches. It was obviously disappointing to see the Vixens lose, but we're not even half way through the season so there's still time to get those all important points.

If you missed my round 6 predictions, [here they are]({{< relref "2018-06-02-round6.md" >}}).

## Wrap-up

|West Coast Fever         |GIANTS Netball        |40%                         |         63|         61|West Coast Fever         |
|NSW Swifts               |Adelaide Thunderbirds |93%                         |         51|         49|NSW Swifts               |
|Magpies Netball          |Queensland Firebirds  |15%                         |         67|         62|Magpies Netball          |

The model took a bit of a beating last round! The only prediction (if we're basing our win cutoff at 50% or greater) that went close was the Swifts---and they were playing the bunnies of the comp, the Thunderbirds. However, the Thunderbirds performed really well in that game, going down by only two goals. Look at the change in the team abilities: the Swifts have lost ability, as they were highly fancied to win by a large margin.

You can see the clear improvement of the Thunderbirds in the team ability figure below: they're progression over the last few weeks is encouraging, and we might start seeing some closer matches.

After getting some wins on the board, the Lightning have boosted their ability, still sticking well in positive territory.

<!-- Is the model now hitting its stride? It gave the Vixens a 36% chance of winning, and unfortunately they went down to the Firebirds, who are looking quite strong. -->

<!-- The Fever were very slight favourites (56%) away from home, and they got the job done against the Lightning who rely do have a premiership hangover. -->

<!-- The Magpies were strong favourites (80%) against the Thunderbirds, and the result was a true thrashing. 20 goals the difference, poor ol' Thunderbirds, looks like another year of dwelling in the cellar. -->

<!-- The final game of the round saw the Swifts beat the Giants. The Giants were hotly fancied by the model (79%), but in a close game, the Swifts got the job done. -->
