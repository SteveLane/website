I've recently been in the US (Raleigh, North Carolina) to be precise, where I found the beer scene to be kicking! Craft beer everywhere, and very inexpensive. Why is our beer so expensive? Is it because we pay huge alcohol taxes, or because the brewers are really making some good coin off us?

Well, I made a little shiny app to explore this. Head over to the [AusBeerTax](https://stevelane.shinyapps.io/ausbeertax/) application to see how much of your hard-earned goes to the government when you buy a slab of beer!
