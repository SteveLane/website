Here are my model predictions for round 8! You can check out my wrap-up of round 7 [here]({{< relref "2018-06-21-round7-wrapup.md" >}}), where I also discuss how the new points system is working halfway through the season. Here's a summary of what [my model]({{< relref "2018-04-22-introduction.md" >}}) is predicting as the outcomes of the matches for round 8:


|Home                     |Away                  |Chance of home team winning |
|:------------------------|:---------------------|:---------------------------|
|Sunshine Coast Lightning |GIANTS Netball        |61%                         |
|West Coast Fever         |Adelaide Thunderbirds |67%                         |
|Magpies Netball          |Melbourne Vixens      |65%                         |
|Queensland Firebirds     |NSW Swifts            |79%                         |

## Score Differential Distributions

The distribution of the predicted score differentials is shown in the figures below. For each game, the chance of the home team winning is calculated and shown in the figure title. Each distribution is coloured by the team's colours, and the more of a single team's colour, the higher the chance that team has of winning. Overlaid on each figure are two vertical, dashed dark green lines; these show the score differential that has a 50% predicted chance of happening.
