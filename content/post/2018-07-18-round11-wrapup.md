The Lightning were heavy model favourites this time around, and managed to scrape in with a two point win over the weekend. The Giants had been preferred by the model, but the Firebirds proved too strong at home. Ridiculously, the model gave the Vixens a 100% chance of winning---whilst they did win, 100% is a bit much!

Congratulations to Tegan Philip on 100 games!
