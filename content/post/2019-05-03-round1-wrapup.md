Well, I wish I could write something great about round 1, but I can't (apart from Go Vixens!). The model was hot on the Swifts, but gave 0 chance to the Magpies and Thunderbirds&emsp;the Thunderbirds are on the board! Clearly there's some model calibration that needs to happen. If you missed my round one predictions, [here they are]({{< relref "2019-04-27-round1.md" >}}).

With some crazy stuff happening, I'm not doing a full write up for a while, but will endeavour to document the models and results at least. Let's see what happens for my [Round 2]({{< relref "2019-05-04-round2.md" >}}) predictions.
