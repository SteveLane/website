To refresh your memory, [here's]({{< relref "2018-04-22-introduction.md" >}}) a description of how my model works.

Predictions for the seventh round are given in the table below. The priors for these distributions are based on the final abilities from last season and the results to round 6.


|Home                  |Away                     |Chance of home team winning |
|:---------------------|:------------------------|:---------------------------|
|GIANTS Netball        |Sunshine Coast Lightning |49%                         |
|Collingwood Magpies   |Melbourne Vixens         |19%                         |
|Adelaide Thunderbirds |NSW Swifts               |27%                         |
|Queensland Firebirds  |West Coast Fever         |14%                         |

## Score Differential Distributions

The distribution of the predicted score differentials is shown in the figures below. For each game, the chance of the home team winning is calculated and shown in the figure title. Each distribution is coloured by the team's colours, and the more of a single team's colour, the higher the chance that team has of winning. Overlaid on each figure are two vertical, dashed dark green lines; these show the score differential that has a 50% predicted chance of happening.

## Comparison of Game Results Against Predictions

The following figure shows the results (score difference of the home team) in [round 6]({{< relref "2021-06-04-round6.md" >}}) (blue vertical line) against the predictions from the model.

The mean average prediction error for the model over the rounds to date is 10.87. The results are shown below, with the MAPE for each game.


|Home                     |Away                  |Chance of home team winning | Home Goals| Away Goals| MAPE|
|:------------------------|:---------------------|:---------------------------|----------:|----------:|----:|
|Collingwood Magpies      |West Coast Fever      |12%                         |         55|         78| 12.9|

|Sunshine Coast Lightning |Queensland Firebirds  |29%                         |         52|         61|  8.3|
|Melbourne Vixens         |Adelaide Thunderbirds |44%                         |         48|         54|  8.6|
